```

## Algokit

### Whats is Algokit

AlgoKit compromises of a number of components that make it the one-stop shop tool for developers building on the Algorand network.

### Explore the blockchain

Use the command `algokit explore`
It will open a new page with the Algorand Explorer "lora".
Anything you do on your local environment will be displayed here.

> You can also see in real time what's going on the blockchain by switching to MainNet.

# Workshop

**You can use the workshop.py** file already [here](https://github.com/SudoWeezy/Introduction/blob/workshop/workshop.py) **OR** do the following:


## Imports

For this workshop you will need to import:

- [Algorand Sdk](https://py-algorand-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Algokit Utils](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/algokit-utils-py/html/index.html)

> To make this less cumbersome, you can import methods from the custom utils file.
> We can also import os, to avoid having to type some commands in the terminal.

```python
import os
import algosdk
import algokit_utils as au
import algokit_utils.transactions.transaction_composer as att

from utils import (
    account_creation,
    display_info,
)
```

## Network Configuration

> We will stay in localnet for this introduction, feel free to modify the `utils.py` file to change network.

We need to setup the [Indexer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/indexer/) & [Algod](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/algod/?from_query=algod#template-modal-overlay) API that are used to interact with the blockchain.

```python
    algorand = au.AlgorandClient.from_environment()
    algod_client = client_configuration()
    indexer_client = indexer_configuration()
```

You can print these 2 values to check the network configuration is working.

```python
    print(algod_client.block_info(0))
    print(indexer_client.health())
```

## Account Creation

We usually use Alice, Bob and Charly as users to illustrate blockchain documentation.
We will give some Algo to Alice. Bob & Charly will get 1000 by default.

```python
    alice = account_creation(algorand, "ALICE", au.AlgoAmount(algo=10000))
    bob = account_creation(algorand, "BOB", au.AlgoAmount(algo=100))
    charly = account_creation(algorand, "CHARLY", au.AlgoAmount(algo=100))
```

## Alice create a new token

### Algokit v3 Release

```python
    result = algorand.send.asset_create(
        au.AssetCreateParams(
            sender=alice.address,
            signer=alice.signer,
            total=15,
            decimals=0,
            default_frozen=False,
            unit_name="PY-CL-FD",  # 8 Max
            asset_name="Proof of Attendance Py-Clermont",
            url="https://pyclermont.org/",
            note="Hello Clermont",
        )
    )
    asset_id = result.confirmation["asset-index"]
```

> Following line are still true, we just prefer to use the above version

### Create an [Asset Configuration Transaction](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-configuration-transaction)

```python
    create_asa_txn =  algosdk.transaction.AssetCreateTxn(
    sender=alice.address,
    sp=algod_client.suggested_params(),
    total=15,
    decimals=0,
    default_frozen=False,
    unit_name="POA", # 8 Max
    asset_name="Proof of Attendance",
    url="https://github.com/SudoWeezy/introduction",
    note="Hello Github",
    )
    create_asa_signed = create_asa.sign(alice.private_key)
```

> On Algorand you can create a token without a smart-contract by using [Algorand Standard Asset](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    participant Algod
    participant Indexer

    Alice->>Algod: AssetCreate
    Algod->>Indexer: Store creation of x Token from Alice
    Algod-->>Alice: Send x Token
```

### [Sign the Transaction](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/signatures/)

```python
    create_asa_tx_id = algod_client.send_transaction(create_asa_signed)
```

### Send the transaction to the network

```python
    res = algosdk.transaction.wait_for_confirmation(algod_client, create_asa_tx_id, 4)
    asset_id = res["asset-index"]
```

## Bob buy the token from Alice

### Algokit v3 Release

```python

    composer = algorand.new_group()

    composer.add_asset_opt_in(
        au.AssetOptInParams(
            sender=bob.address,
            signer=bob.signer,
            asset_id=asset_id
        )
    )
    composer.add_payment(
        au.PaymentParams(
            sender=bob.address,
            signer=bob.signer,
            receiver=alice.address,
            amount=au.AlgoAmount(algo=10),
        )
    )
    composer.add_asset_transfer(
        au.AssetTransferParams(
            sender=alice.address,
            signer=alice.signer,
            receiver=bob.address,
            amount=1,
            asset_id=asset_id,
        )
    )

    result = composer.send()

```

### [Atomic transfer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atomic_transfers/)

This simply means that transactions that are part of the transfer either all succeed or all fail. 

[Why it is needed in video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTFgvZm1bCk)

### [Atomic Transaction composer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atc/)

We will bind 3 transactions in the atomic transfer:

- Bob allow the asset created by Alice to enter his account -> [Opt-in](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-optin-transaction)
- Bob send the money to Alice -> [Payment](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#payment-transaction)
- Alice send the token to Bob -> [Asset Transfer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-transfer-transaction)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    participant Algod
    participant Indexer

    rect rgba(200, 200, 255, 0.2)
    Note over Bob,Algod: Atomic transfer

    Bob->>Algod: Opt-in
    Algod->>Indexer: Store "Allow Bob to receive Token"
    Algod-->>Bob: Send 0 Token

    Bob->>Algod: Algo Payment
    Algod->>Indexer: Store "Allow Payment from Bob to Alice"
    Bob-->>Alice: Send Algo
 
    Alice->>Algod: Asset transfer
    Algod->>Indexer: Store "Alice Transfer ASA to Bob"
    Alice-->>Bob: Send Y ASA
    end
```

## [Smart contract](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/apps/)

Now that you have some experience in building transactions. Even if we are using blockchain, we still need a backend to trigger each transaction. This is not really efficient.
Let's deploy a smart contract on the blockchain so that everyone can interact with it directly.

### Define the Digital Market Place

We will define 5 methods:

- `create_application` (Initialize the smart contract with the asset_id and the unitary_price)
- [Optional] `set_price` (In case Alice changes her mind and wants to change the price)
- `opt_in_to_asset` (Like Any account, to hold an asset, the smart contract needs to opt-in)
- `buy` (Allows someone to buy an asset from the smart contract)
- `delete_application` (When Alice don't wants to send her token anymore and get the money back)

**You can use the app.py** file already [here](https://github.com/SudoWeezy/Introduction/blob/workshop/app.py) **OR** do the following:

#### Code the smart contract

```python
from algopy import (
    Asset,  # On Algorand, assets are native objects rather than smart contracts
    Global, # Global is used to access global variables from the network
    Txn,    # Txn is used access information about the current transaction
    UInt64, # By default, all numbers in the AVM are 64-bit unsigned integers
    arc4,   # ARC4 defines the Algorand ABI for method calling and type encoding
    gtxn,   # gtxn is used to read transaction within the same atomic group
    itxn,   # itxn is used to send transactions from within a smart contract
)
```

```python
class DigitalMarketplace(arc4.ARC4Contract):
    asset_id: UInt64      # We want to store the ID for the asset we are selling
    unitary_price: UInt64 # We want to store the price for the asset we are selling
    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["NoOp"],create="require")
        # There are certain actions that a contract call can do
        # Some examples are UpdateApplication, DeleteApplication, and NoOp
        # NoOp is a call that does nothing special after it is exected    
        # Require that this method is only callable when creating the app
    def create_application(self, asset_id: Asset, unitary_price: UInt64) -> None:
        self.asset_id = asset_id.id # The ID of the asset we're selling
        self.unitary_price = unitary_price # The initial sale price

    @arc4.abimethod
    def set_price(self, unitary_price: UInt64) -> None:
        assert Txn.sender == Global.creator_address # We don't want anyone to be able to modify the price, only the app creator can
        self.unitary_price = unitary_price

    # Before any account can receive an asset, it must opt-in to it
    # This method enables the application to opt-in to the asset
    @arc4.abimethod
    def opt_in_to_asset(self, mbr_pay: gtxn.PaymentTransaction) -> None: # Need to send a payment to cover data usage
        # We want to make sure that the application address is not already opted in
        assert not Global.current_application_address.is_opted_in(Asset(self.asset_id))
        assert mbr_pay.receiver == Global.current_application_address
        # Every accounts has an MBR of 0.1 ALGO (Global.min_balance)
        # Opting into an asset increases the MBR by 0.1 ALGO (Global.asset_opt_in_min_balance)
        assert mbr_pay.amount == Global.min_balance + Global.asset_opt_in_min_balance
        itxn.AssetTransfer(
            xfer_asset=self.asset_id,
            asset_receiver=Global.current_application_address,
            asset_amount=0,
        ).submit()

    @arc4.abimethod
    def buy(self, buyer_txn: gtxn.PaymentTransaction, quantity: UInt64) -> None:
        # To buy assets, a payment must be sent
        # The quantity of assets to buy

        # We need to verify that the payment is being sent to the application
        # and is enough to cover the cost of the asset
        assert buyer_txn.sender == Txn.sender
        assert buyer_txn.receiver == Global.current_application_address
        assert buyer_txn.amount == self.unitary_price * quantity

        # Once we've verified the payment, we can transfer the asset
        itxn.AssetTransfer(
            xfer_asset=self.asset_id,
            asset_receiver=Txn.sender,
            asset_amount=quantity,
        ).submit()

    @arc4.abimethod(allow_actions=["DeleteApplication"])
    def delete_application(self) -> None: # Only allow the creator to delete the application
        assert Txn.sender == Global.creator_address # Send all the unsold assets to the creator
        itxn.AssetTransfer(
            xfer_asset=self.asset_id,
            asset_receiver=Global.creator_address,
            asset_amount=0,
            # Close the asset to unlock the 0.1 ALGO that was locked in opt_in_to_asset
            asset_close_to=Global.creator_address,
        ).submit()
        itxn.Payment(receiver=Global.creator_address, amount=0, close_remainder_to=Global.creator_address).submit()
        # Get back ALL the ALGO in the creatoraccount
```

#### Compile the smart contract

The following command will compile the smart contract and output the ABI and the TEAL File.

[Teal is the language of the Algorand Virtual Machine](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/specification/)

```python
os.system("algokit compile py --out-dir ./app app.py")
```

#### Create the client for the application

Similar to an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).
Now that we have the ABI and the Teal file, we will generate the client to interact with the application.

```python
os.system("algokit generate client app/DigitalMarketplace.arc32.json --output client.py")
```

### Interact with the smart contract

#### Initialize the client

```python
    import client as cl

    factory = algorand.client.get_typed_app_factory(
        cl.DigitalMarketplaceFactory, default_sender=alice.address
    )

```

#### Alice create the smart contract

[Application call Transaction](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#application-call-transaction)

```python
    result, _ = factory.send.create.create_application(
        cl.CreateApplicationArgs(
            asset_id=asset_id, unitary_price=price.micro_algo
        )
    )
    app_id = result.app_id
    ac = factory.get_app_client_by_id(app_id, default_sender=alice.address)
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Charly
    participant SmartContract
    participant Algod
    participant Indexer

    Alice->>Algod: CreateApp
    Algod->>Indexer: Store creation of DigitalMarketPlace
    Algod-->>SmartContract: Create
```

#### Transfer ASA to DigitalMarketplace

```python
    sp = algorand.get_suggested_params()
    mbr_pay_txn = algorand.create_transaction.payment(
        au.PaymentParams(
            sender=alice.address,
            receiver=ac.app_address,
            amount=au.AlgoAmount(algo=0.2),
            extra_fee=au.AlgoAmount(micro_algo=sp.min_fee)
        )
    )
    ac.send.opt_in_to_asset(
        cl.OptInToAssetArgs(
            mbr_pay=att.TransactionWithSigner(mbr_pay_txn, alice.signer)
        ),
        au.CommonAppCallParams(
            asset_references=[asset_id]
        )
    )
    

    print(f"App can now Hold ASA-ID= {algod_client.account_info(app_client.app_address)['assets']}")
    
    print("Alice send ASAs to the App")
    algorand.send.asset_transfer(
        au.AssetTransferParams(
            sender=alice.address,
            signer=alice.signer,
            amount=10,
            receiver=ac.app_address,
            asset_id=asset_id
        )
    )
    print(f"Hold ASA-ID= {algod_client.account_info(app_client.app_address)['assets']}")
```

> To simplify, from now on, I will replace Algod, Indexer and Smart_Contract by "Smart_Contract".

```

#### Charly Buy a token from the Smart Contract

```python
    amt_to_buy = 2
    print(f"Charly buy {amt_to_buy} token")
    composer = algorand.new_group()
    composer.add_asset_opt_in(
        au.AssetOptInParams(
            sender=charly.address,
            signer=charly.signer,
            asset_id=asset_id
        )
    )
    buyer_payment_txn = algorand.create_transaction.payment(
        au.PaymentParams(
            sender=charly.address,
            receiver=ac.app_address,
            amount=au.AlgoAmount(
                micro_algo=amt_to_buy*ac.state.global_state.unitary_price
            ),
            extra_fee=au.AlgoAmount(micro_algo=sp.min_fee)
        )
    )
    atc = au.AtomicTransactionComposer()
    composer.add_app_call_method_call(

            cl.BuyArgs(
                buyer_txn=att.TransactionWithSigner(

                ),
                quantity=2
            ),
            au.CommonAppCallParams(
                sender=charly.address,
                signer=charly.signer,
                # Inform the AVM that the transaction uses this asset
                asset_references=[asset_id],
            )
        )
    )
    composer.send()
```

    Charly->>Charly: Opt-in Token
    Charly->>SmartContract: Buy
    SmartContract-->>Charly: Send ASA
    end
```

#### Delete Application

Now that some user bought Tokens, Alice wants to delete the Smart-Contract to get Algo and tokens back.

```python
    print("Alice delete the app and get ASA and Algo back")

    ac.send.delete.delete_application(
        au.CommonAppCallParams(
            # Tell the AVM that the transaction involves this asset
            asset_references=[asset_id],
            extra_fee=au.AlgoAmount(micro_algo=3*sp.min_fee)
        )
    )
```

    end
```
